        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <p><strong>2020</strong></p>
        <p>QUEENSBOUND 2020 launched in April 2020 in honor of National Poetry Month, featuring 16 new contributors and the work of the 17 contributors from the 2018 edition. Web design by Lexi Namer; our 2020 logo was designed by Kyle Richard.</p>
        <p>For QUEENSBOUND 2020, contributors and editorial board members Abeer Y. Hoque, Jared Harél, Joseph O. Legaspi, and founder KC Trommer have invited new contributors to the project, including Nadia Q. Ahmad, Amy M. Alvarez, Pichchenda Bao, Ryan Black, Nana Brew-Hammond, Francisco Delgado, Ariel Francisco, Ellen Hagan, Kimiko Hahn, Robert Ostrom, Bushra Rehman, Sahar Romani, Jackie Sherbow, Mariahedessa Ekere Tallie, and Sweta Srivastava Vikram.</p>
        <p><strong>2019</strong></p>
        <p>In 2019, QUEENSBOUND partnered with Fractured Atlas for fiscal sponsorship and we formed an editorial board, consisting of Abeer Y. Hoque, Joseph O. Legaspi, Jared Harél, and founder KC Trommer. We did this to think about how we could work together, with an idea that we would one day be able to feature a poem for each station stop in Queens, doing some train readings along the way. Website developer Lexi Namer has joined QUEENSBOUND and is developing a dedicated site for the project. Award-winning audio producer and editor Ann Heppermann will be recording and editing audio for us in 2020.</p>
        <p><strong>2018</strong></p>
        <p>Reading and Site Launch - 11/3 at 2 pm  - The 7 train, first car On November 3, 2018, the QUEENSBOUND project launched with a reading on the 7 line and reception at the Queens Museum. Some of the leading writers and poets of Queens, including Rosebud Ben-Oni, Malcolm Chang, Catherine Fletcher, Sherese Francis, Jared Harél, Nicole Haroutunian, Abeer Hoque, Safia Jama, Paolo Javier, Joseph O. Legaspi, Ananda Lima, Maria Lisella, Vikas K. Menon, Belal Mobarak, Meera Nair, Maria Terrone, and curator and host KC Trommer, read original work on the 7 train, beginning at Vernon Blvd Jackson Av stop, before stepping off at Mets-Willets Point and heading over to The Queens Museum for a reception. The event concluded with a song which included lines from every poem in the launch from Adam DeGraff and Tyler Burba, hosts of the reading series Kith & Kin. The excellent idea to present a reading on the train was the suggestion of Jackson Heights artist Deborah Wasserman.</p>
